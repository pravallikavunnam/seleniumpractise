						//TestNG
		/* TestNG is a unit Testing Framework
		 * TestNG works with JAVA 
		 * It is developed for Java Developers
		 * For Pyhton ---we have PyTest unit testing framework ---we cannot use TestNG for Python
		 * For C# --we use NUnit 
		 * For JavaScript --we have Jasmine API's
		 * TestNG is dedicatedly designed for developers
		 * We are using Selenium with Java so we can use features of TestNG along with the selenium
		 * The purpose of TestNG is to write test cases
		 * Test steps writing with the help of selenium we cannot Assert them using selenium
		 * With the help of TestNG we can Assert
		 * Assert means --we have to write Validation or verification points or check points 
		 * ------we have to write whatever we are doing is correct or not
		 * like Actual vs Expected result in Manual Testing
		 * TestNG works on the basis of annotations
		 * annotations is special method which is written with  @ 
		 * @Before ,@ After ----this are called Annotations
		 * TestNG is open source library
		 * 
		 * @Before ----it is like precondition
		 * @Test   --Test Steps
		 * @After    
		 * 
		 * 
		 * 1.Along with TestNG we get Reports also  --How many TC Pass/Fail
		 * only with selenium we cannot get Reports
		 * We can generate HTML REport
		 * 
		 * -Default HTML Reports ---Refresh project--testOutput---index.html and emailable-report.html
		 * 
		 * --all the failed test cases entry will be there in testng-failed.xml
		 * 
		 * 2.With the help of TestNG we can define priority of test cases
		 * 
		 * 
		 * 3.TestNG provides some amazing features with DataProviders
		 * 
		 * DataProviders : With the help of DataProvider we can create one single method to access number of users 
		 *  
		 * With the help of we can do Data Driven Testing also
		 * 
		 * 4.We have some core features of TestNG  --how to handle Exceptions,Dependencies
		 * 
		 * 5.TestNG Listeners --- they have given various listeners to customize the report like fancy report,generate some graphs,
		 * ----colors and add some more attributes
		 *   Various vendors available in the market --used TestNG listeners internally and they have created Reports like---
		 *   Extent Report or Allure Report ---If we want to use Extent Report with selenium we really need TestNG Listeneres
		 *   
		 * 6.TestNG Runners ---In the form of TestNG.xml files ---it is like a test suite or runner concept
		 * we give access of 10 test cases in xml and run them together  -----
		 * ---all 10 test classes will be executed along with xml file and give the result how many test cases pass or fail
		 * 
		 *  a) With the help of TestNG xml file we can arrange the test cases 
		 * 
			b) We can perform Parallel Testing ---parallel testing with selenium we cannot do we need to use third party tool
		 * 
		 *  c) Parameters/Parameterization--how to pass run time parameters or command line parameters
		 * 
		 * 7. Retry Logic ---test failed then when used retrylogic based on the count it will run the test cases again
		 * 
		 * 8. Different Annotations 
		 *
		 * 9. TestNG --doesn't have any UI no look and feel
		 *        --It is a pure JAR file 
		 *  1. We have to go POM.xml  and add TestNG dependency  --to write TestNG Code
		 *  2. We have to download TestNG plugin --to run test cases with TestNG
		 * 	3. Integrate Maven with TestNG --how to execute TestNG testcase with the help of maven with  Surefirepulgin
		 *
